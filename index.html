                Hello world!
            </div>

                On top of that, I want to make an impact on this world through technology. I have
                always been into programming. In fact, I am a self-taught programmer. I used to teach
                computer-related subjects in high school and had been working as a software engineer
                in a local startup for 1 year. After that, I had been working in the Ministry of Commerce
                as official. In short, I had been working in different environments from dealing with
                kids to working with foreign government officials and from IT domain to commerce.
                Furthermore, the tech industry is growing at an unprecedented pace and touches every
                aspect of life. This means there will be a lot of exciting opportunities out there but at
                the same time, there will also be a lot of competitions.
