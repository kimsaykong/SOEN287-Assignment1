                I had been working in a variety of positions such as
                computer teacher, Software engineer and government official where I learnt how to
                communicate with different types of individuals ranging from students to foreign
                government officials, to create guidelines/policies, to mentor others, etc. While I was
                working as a Software Engineer in a startup in Cambodia, I was responsible for the
                whole life cycle of the systems (specifically, Human Capital Management System) from
                gathering requirements to deploying to production for high profile clients.
                In addition, Software Engineering is more than just writing code, but understanding
                requirements, communication among stakeholders, understanding risks and much
                more which is the skill set I acquired and honed during my tenure in the Ministry of
                Commerce, Cambodia. I hope that this skill set will help me stand out from the crowd.

            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p class="bio">
                I am an experienced business negotiator and a self-taught software developer in Cambodia. I began working in software development for a year, and
                I shift my career to government official for 3 years. I received my bachelor's degree in Business Administer from Norton University in Cambodia.
                I got married to my wonderful wife in 2017 and decided to take a couple of years off. I relocated to Canada to live with my wife, and we
                have one lovely son. During my transition to canada, I acquire a new skill as a sushi chef, and I have been working as a sushi chef since 2017.
                In 2020, I went back to school for bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Concordia because I want to be more for
                my son. I want him to be proud of me for not giving up on bettering myself and to see me as his role model.
